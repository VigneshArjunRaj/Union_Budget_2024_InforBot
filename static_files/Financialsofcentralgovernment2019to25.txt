Finances of the Central Government (2019-20 to 2024-25)
This note looks at certain trends in the finances of the central government for the period from 2019-20 to 2024-
25. The initial years of 2019-20 and 2020-21, were marked by economic slowdown and the COVID-19
pandemic. The imposition of national lockdown in 2020-21, took a toll on the finances of the central
government. Tax collection plummeted while fiscal and revenue deficits increased to multi-year highs.
However, some of the increase in the central government’s fiscal deficit was because of clearing of unpaid
subsidy dues from previous years.
In the post pandemic period, the central government has significantly increased budgetary expenditure on capital
outlay. It has also been providing interest free loans to states for capital expenditure. On the revenue side, the
central government’s gross tax revenue as a percentage of GDP has remained broadly similar. However, it has
consistently fallen short of meeting its disinvestment estimates. This note was originally published in February
2024 after the interim budget. It has been updated to reflect the latest budget estimates for 2024-25 as presented
in July 2024.
Capital expenditure of public sector at lower levels despite higher budgetary outlay
The central government undertakes capital outlay in various sectors such as defence, railways, roads, and
highways. Capital outlay leads to the creation of assets and increases the economy’s productive capacity along
with promoting efficiency.
1
 There are two broad ways of funding public sector capital outlay: (i) through direct
budgetary support by the central government or (ii) mobilising resources by public enterprises and departmental
undertakings. Public enterprises and departmental undertakings (such as Indian Railways under the Ministry of
Railways) can mobilise resources for capital investment through various sources such as utilising internal
receipts, issuing bonds, and external commercial borrowings. These are also known as internal and extrabudgetary resources (IEBR).
Figure 1: Capital expenditure by central government
and public enterprises (% of GDP)

Between 2019-20 and 2024-25, budgetary support
for capital outlay is seen increasing from 1.5% of
GDP to 2.8% of GDP. This has been supported by
higher fiscal deficit by the Centre. At the same
time, capital investments by public enterprises
financed through IEBR is seen decreasing from
3.2% of GDP to 1.1% of GDP. This indicates
substitution of capital investment of public entities
by budgetary spending. Note that while budgetary
spending on capital outlay has increased, public
sector capital expenditure (including Centre and
public entities) is estimated to decrease from 4.7%
of GDP in 2019-20 to 3.9% of GDP in 2024-25. A
significant portion of this substitution has
happened in railways and roads. Since 2019-20,
capital outlay on railways, roads, and defence have
accounted for over 70% of the budgetary spending
on capital outlay. In 2019-20, IEBR of railways
and roads accounted for 24% of total IEBR. This
has reduced to 4% of total IEBR to be raised by
Railways and none for roads in 2024-25.
One of the reasons for reducing the practice of raising funds through IEBR could be the increasing indebtedness
of certain public entities. For instance, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways did not mandate the
National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to raise funds from IEBR given its increasing debt servicing
obligations.2
 As of February 28, 2023, NHAI’s total outstanding debt was Rs 3.43 lakh crore.3
 Its debt
servicing as a share of total allocation was 25% in 2021-22 which is expected to decrease to 21% in 2027-28.2

The Standing Committee on Transport (2022) had noted that high budgetary support alone may not be sufficient
to meet the investment requirements of NHAI.4


Share of fertiliser subsidies increased while petroleum subsidies phased out
In 2024-25, the central government’s expenditure on providing subsidies is estimated to be 1.3% of GDP and
12% of its total revenue expenditure. The central government provides various subsidies such as food subsidy,
subsidised fertilisers, petroleum subsidy (for LPG), and interest subsidies.
Between 2019-20 and 2024-25, expenditure on
fertiliser subsidy is estimated to increase annually by
15%. Petroleum subsidy reduced from Rs 38,529
crore in 2019-20 to Rs 11,925 crore in 2024-25 as per
budget estimates, and is now mainly for providing
LPG to poor families. Food subsidy, after adjusting
for National Small Savings Fund (NSSF) loans,
increased by 4% annually in the same period. Food
subsidy is provided to: (i) the FCI for distribution of
foodgrains under the National Food Security Act
(NFSA), 2013 and (ii) states for decentralised
procurement of foodgrains.5
 In the past, various
recommendations have been made to rationalise the
increasing expenditure on food subsidy. These
include: (i) revising the central issue price and (ii)
providing direct transfer of cash subsidy to
beneficiaries.5,6,7 Between April 2020 and December
2022, the central government provided additional
foodgrains to NFSA beneficiaries for free. In
November 2023, the central government decided to
provide free foodgrains to NFSA beneficiaries for five
years from January 1, 2024 onwards at a cost of Rs
11.8 lakh crore.8

GDP

Fertiliser subsidy is paid to manufacturers and importers who sell fertilisers to farmers at less than market
prices.5
 In the production of fertilisers, India is heavily dependent on imports for procuring raw materials.5
 The
15th Finance Commission had noted that such dependence makes India vulnerable to volatility in international
prices and makes fertiliser subsidies unsustainable.5
 In the past, the central government has resorted to offbudget financing to defer payment of fertiliser subsidy.9
 The Standing Committee on Chemicals and Fertilizers
(2020) had observed that several fertiliser plants operate with very old technology.10
 Thus, the government
bears the cost of this inefficiency in terms of higher subsidy. It recommended that farmers should receive
fertiliser subsidy directly in their bank accounts while manufacturers should be free to produce and sell
fertilisers as per their own system.10

Most revenue receipts spent on committed expenditure, subsidies, grants, key schemes

items

Revenue expenditure implies spending on
items which do not lead to creation of assets.
Some of the major items of revenue
expenditure for the central government
include committed expenditure (interest,
pension, salaries), subsidies, finance
commission grants to states, and certain key
schemes. Between 2019-20 and 2024-25, the
central government’s expenditure on these
items is estimated to account for over 85% of
its revenue receipts. In this period, the
central government consistently spent more
than 60% of its revenue receipts on interest,
salaries, and pension. This was followed by
spending on food, fertiliser, and petroleum
subsidies. Since 2020-21, the Centre has
spent at least 10% of its revenue receipts on
four schemes—MGNREGS, Jal Jeevan
Mission, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, and
PM-KISAN. Note that the components
shown in Figure 3 do not include revenue
expenditure on other centrally sponsored
schemes, central sector schemes, and
establishment expenditure.

Other revenue expenditure not included in Figure 3 have accounted for at least 30% of the central government’s
revenue receipts between 2019-20 and 2024-25. Incurring revenue expenditure in excess of revenue receipts
implies that the central government has continued to be in revenue deficit since 2019-20 (see page 4). To
maintain a revenue balance, the central government either would have to increase revenue receipts or reduce
revenue expenditure. Note that committed expenditure on interest, salaries, and pension is difficult to
rationalise in the short to medium term. Finance commission grants given to states are also broadly unchanged
once the recommendations are accepted by the central government.
Central government’s gross tax revenue has remained largely unchanged
In 2019-20 and 2020-21, the central government’s
gross tax revenue decreased to around 10% of GDP
on account of economic slowdown and the COVID19 pandemic respectively. It has since then
recovered to reach around 11%-11.5% of GDP which
was the rate prior to 2019-20. Income tax,
corporation tax, and goods and services tax (GST)
have accounted for over 70% of the central
government’s gross tax revenue since 2018-19. In
2024-25, revenue from each of these three tax
sources is estimated to be around 3%-3.5% of GDP.
In recent years, there has been a decrease in the
contribution of corporate tax to the gross tax revenue.
This has been driven by the reduction in corporate tax
rates to attract investment and support economic
growth.11
 Revenue from income tax has seen an
increase in this period. The 15th Finance Commission
had noted that India’s tax base was very narrow.
12

With effect from 2020-21, the central government
introduced a new personal income tax regime where
tax rates will be reduced if tax payers forgo certain
exemptions and deductions.

major taxes as % of GDP

GST was introduced in July 2017 and subsumed various taxes at the level of the Centre and states. Some of the
central taxes which were subsumed under GST include central excise duty, service tax, and central sales tax.12

Revenue from GST has remained stable at around 3% of GDP since 2018-19 except in 2020-21 when it had
reduced to 2.8% of GDP. The 15th Finance Commission had made various recommendations to improve the
efficiency of GST. These include: (i) correcting the inverted duty structure (GST rate on intermediates being
higher than final goods), (ii) improving compliance, (iii) minimising exemptions, and (iv) operating with a
three-rate structure by merging tax rates.

Significant revenue raised through cesses and surcharges impacting funds devolved to states
The Constitution allows the central government to
levy cesses and surcharges. However, they do not
form a part of the divisible pool of taxes from which
revenue is devolved to states as per finance
commission recommendations.
13
 A cess is levied for
a specific purpose to provide financial support to a
sector or area.12 Surcharges are also levied for short
periods.12
 In recent years, the central government has
mobilised a significant amount of its revenue by
levying cesses and surcharges. In 2020-21 and 2021-
22, the share of revenue raised by levying various
cesses and surcharges was 20% and 18% respectively
in the central government’s gross tax revenue (GTR)
(see Figure 5). Between 2017-18 and 2024-25, the
central government’s revenue from cesses and
surcharges is estimated to increase at an annual rate
of 15% while the growth in the total gross tax
revenue is estimated to be lower at 10% per year.

surcharges in Centre's GTR
Note: Figures exclude GST compensation cess. RE is revised
estimate and BE is budget estimate.
Sources: RBI; Union Budget Documents; PRS.
The increase in cesses and surcharges has led to a decrease in devolution to states as share of the gross tax
revenue. Thus, the finance commission formula for devolving 41% of the divisible pool has translated into 32%
of the gross tax revenue in 2024-25 as per budget estimates. In 2019, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) noted
that levying cesses and surcharges neutralises the increase in tax devolution recommended by successive finance

 The RBI observed that new cesses on imports had been levied to make up for the cesses which
were subsumed under the GST. Revenue raised from cess and surcharges is estimated to decrease to 14% of
gross tax revenue in 2024-25.
Receipts from disinvestments have consistently fallen short of budget estimates
Figure 6: Receipts from disinvestment (Rs crore)
Note: RE is revised estimate and BE is budget estimate.
Sources: Union Budget Documents; PRS.
Disinvestment involves the sale of government’s
shareholding in public sector enterprises. It is the
dominant source of capital receipts for the central
government. In February 2021, the central
government notified the new public sector enterprise
(PSE) policy.15
 The policy envisages reducing the
presence of central PSEs across sectors through
privatisation, merger, or closure. Only a bare
minimum presence of CPSEs will be maintained in
strategic sectors such as defence, power, and
banking.15 PSEs in non-strategic sectors will be
privatised or closed.
16
 However, between 2019-20
and 2023-24, the central government has consistently
fallen short of achieving its budget target for
disinvestment. In 2023-24, the central government’s
revised disinvestment receipts are estimated to be
51% lower than the budget estimates. In 2024-25,
the Centre has budgeted to raise Rs 50,000 crore
from disinvestment.
The central government has discontinued the sale of its shareholding in one PSU to another PSU which was one
of the ways in which it had met its disinvestment targets in the past. In 2017-18 and 2018-19, when the Centre
exceeded its budgeted disinvestment targets, 37% and 17% of such receipts accrued from PSUs buying the
government’s shareholding in other PSUs.
17
 Similar transactions were also done in 2019-20. In 2020, the
Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India had noted that such transactions only resulted in transfer of
resources with the public sector to the government.18
 It did not lead to any change in the stake of the public
sector/government in the disinvested PSUs.
18
 Since 2020-21, the central government has not executed
transactions involving sale of one PSU to another PSU.

Deficits and debts are at an elevated level
Revenue and fiscal deficit of the central government
increased substantially in 2020-21. However, some
of the increase (1.7% of GDP) was due to clearing
off loans given to FCI for food subsidy dues from
previous years. Since then, deficits have reduced.
However, the Centre has continued to incur a
substantial revenue deficit. Revenue deficit implies
that the government is borrowing to finance
expenditure which does not lead to creation of assets
or reduces liabilities. The FRBM Review
Committee (2017) said that financing recurring
expenditure through borrowings is not desirable and
they should be financed through tax revenues.19

The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management
Act, 2003 required the central government to limit
its fiscal deficit to 3% of GDP by March 31, 2021.20

In 2021, the Centre proposed to amend the Act to
reflect the redrawn fiscal consolidation roadmap.21

The announced fiscal deficit target for 2025-26 is
below 4.5% of GDP.21
Figure 7: Revenue deficit and fiscal deficit as % of
GDP
Note: RE is revised estimate and BE is budget estimate.
Sources: Union Budget Documents; PRS.
Along with elevated revenue and fiscal deficits, the central government’s liabilities have also reached beyond
limits prescribed under the FRBM Act. In 2018, the FRBM Act was amended to limit general government debt
(Centre and states) at 60% of GDP.
20
 Out of this, central government debt was capped at 40% of GDP which
was to be achieved by 2024-25. This was in line with the recommendations of the FRBM review committee.19

In 2018-19, the Centre’s debt to GDP ratio was at 48% of GDP which increased to 61% of GDP in 2020-21,
following economic slowdown and the impact of COVID-19 on government spending and revenue. Since then,
it is estimated to reduce to 57% of GDP in 2024-25. High level of debt has contributed to the central
government spending a significant portion of its revenue receipts on interest payments. In 2019-20, the central

government spent 36% of its revenue receipts on interest payments which is estimated to increase to 37% of
revenue receipts as per budget estimates of 2024-25.

Centre has been reporting off-budget loans; however, issues persist with disclosures
Off-budget borrowings refer to borrowings that are not directly made by the government, but where principal
and interest are serviced from the government budget. Such borrowings are typically raised by governmentowned entities such as public sector enterprises. As these borrowings are not part of the government budget
documents, they lead to understatement of fiscal deficit. CAG(2018) had noted that the central government had
resorted to off-budget financing for items such as food subsidy bills and implementation of irrigation schemes.9

It recommended that the central government may put in place a framework to disclose off-budget financing.9

Since 2019-20, the central government has
provided a statement disclosing off-budget
borrowings raised by public enterprises. These
were raised by: (i) issuing bonds by public
enterprises which were serviced by the central
government and (ii) providing loans to public
enterprises from the NSSF. For instance,
between 2016-17 and 2020-21, loans worth Rs
4.3 lakh crore were provided to the Food
Corporation of India from the NSSF. They were
provided in lieu of food subsidy dues owed by
the Centre to the FCI. These loans to the FCI
accounted for 67% of the total off-budget
borrowings raised during this period. Had these
loans been included in the Centre’s borrowings,
its actual fiscal deficit would have been higher
than the reported fiscal deficit between 2016-17
and 2020-21 (see Figure 10). In 2018-19 and
2019-20, the Centre’s fiscal deficit after
accounting for off-budget borrowings would
have been almost one percentage point higher
than the reported fiscal deficit.

off-budget borrowings (% of GDP)
Note: Fiscal deficit as percentage of GDP calculated as per latest GDP
figures. RE is revised estimate and BE is budget estimate.

CAG has highlighted issues in the disclosure of off-budget borrowings by the central government. It noted that
the Centre did not include an amount of Rs 14,985 crore in its disclosure which was raised by Air India Assets
Holding Limited in 2019-20.22
 Servicing of this debt was to be done through budgetary support provided by the
Ministry of Civil Aviation. Similarly, a one-time financing arrangement of Rs 50,551 crore for the railways
through the Indian Railways Finance Corporation (IRFC) Limited should have also been included in the
Centre’s disclosure for 2020-21.22
 Note that if these items are included in off-budget borrowings, then the
adjusted fiscal deficit as shown in Figure 10 would be higher by 0.1 percentage point and 0.3 percentage point in
2019-20 and 2020-21 respectively.
