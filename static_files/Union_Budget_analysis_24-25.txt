Budget estimates of 2024-25 as compared to revised estimates of 2023-24

Total Expenditure:  The government is estimated to spend Rs 47,65,768 crore in 2024-25.  This is an increase of 6% over the revised estimate of 2023-24.

Revenue expenditure is estimated to grow at 3.2% and capital expenditure at 16.9%.  The revenue expenditure growth has been kept in check due to pension, defence expenditure, subsidies, and major schemes (MGNREGS, Jal Jeevan Mission, and PM-KISAN) together being allotted roughly the same as the revised estimate for 2023-24.

Total Receipts:  Government receipts (excluding borrowings) are estimated to be Rs 30,80,274 crore, 11.8% higher than the revised estimates of 2023-24.  The gap between these receipts and the expenditure will be plugged by borrowings, budgeted to be Rs 16,85,494 crore, 2.8% lower than the revised estimate of 2023-24.

Transfer to states:  The central government will transfer Rs 22,74,541 crore to states and union territories in 2024-25, an increase of 8.4% over the revised estimates of 2023-24. Transfer to states includes devolution of Rs 12,19,783 crore out of the divisible pool of central taxes, grants worth Rs 8,90,858 crore, and special loans worth Rs 1,30,000 crore for capital expenditure.

Deficits:  Revenue deficit is targeted at 2% of GDP, lower than the 2.9% budgeted in 2023-24. Fiscal deficit is targeted at 5.1% of GDP in 2024-25, lower than the revised estimates for 2023-24 (5.9% of GDP).  The lower fiscal deficit is on account of receipts growing at 11.8%, which is higher than the expenditure growth of 6%. 

GDP growth estimate:  The nominal GDP is estimated to grow at a rate of 10.5% in 2024-25.

Expenditure which brings a change to the government’s assets or liabilities (such as construction of roads or recovery of loans) is capital expenditure, and all other expenses are revenue expenditure (such as payment of salaries or interest payments).  In 2024-25, capital expenditure is expected to increase by about 17% over the revised estimates of 2023-24.  Revenue expenditure is expected to increase by 3.2% over the revised estimates of 2023-24.

Disinvestment is the government selling its stakes in Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs).  In 2023-24, the government is estimated to meet 49% of its disinvestment target.  The disinvestment target for 2024-25 is Rs 50,000 crore, lower than the budget target of 2023-24 (Rs 61,000 crore).     Disinvestment targets have reduced for the fourth consecutive year, from 2020-21 onwards.

Receipts Highlights for 2024-25

Receipts (excluding borrowings) in 2024-25 are estimated to be Rs 30,80,275 crore, an increase of 11.8% over the revised estimates of 2023-24.  This is mainly on account of centre’s net tax revenue growing by 11.9%.  

Gross tax revenue is budgeted to increase by 11.5% in 2024-25, over the revised estimates of 2023-24.  This is greater than the estimated nominal GDP growth of 10.5% in 2024-25.  Corporation tax and income tax are estimated to grow at about 13%.  GST revenue is budgeted to increase by 11.6%.  

Devolution to states from centre’s tax revenue is estimated to be Rs 12,19,783 crore in 2024-25, an increase of 10.4% over the revised estimates of 2023-24.  In 2023-24, devolution to states is estimated to be higher by Rs 83,045 crore, from an initial estimate of Rs 10,21,448 crore.  

Net tax revenue (excluding states’ share in taxes) is estimated to be Rs 26,01,574 crore in 2024-25, which is about 12% higher over the revised estimate for 2023-24.  The revised estimate for net tax revenue in 2023-24 is roughly same as the budget estimate for the year.

Non-tax revenue consists mainly of interest receipts on loans given by the centre, dividends, license fees, tolls, and charges for government services.  It is estimated at Rs 3,99,701 crore in 2024-25, an increase of 6.4% over the revised estimate of 2023-24.  

Capital receipts (excluding borrowings) are targeted at Rs 79,000 crore, an increase of 41% over the revised estimates of 2023-24.  Note that the 2023-24 revised estimate for capital receipts is estimated to be 33% lower than the budgeted amount.  Lower receipts were on account of disinvestment targets not being met.

Indirect taxes: The total indirect tax collections are estimated to be Rs 16,17,840 crore in 2024-25.   Of this, the government has estimated to raise Rs 10,67,650 crore from GST.  Out of the total tax collections under GST, 86% is expected to come from CGST (Rs 9,17,650 crore), and 14% from the GST compensation cess (Rs 1,50,000 crore).    

Corporation tax: The collection from taxes on companies is expected to increase by 13% in 2024-25.  

Income tax: The collections from income tax are also expected to increase to Rs 11,56,000 crore in 2024-25 (13%).  The revised estimate for 2023-24 is 13.5% higher than the amount budgeted in the year (Rs 9,00,575 crore).  

Non-tax receipts: In 2024-25, non-tax revenue is expected to increase by 6.4% over the revised estimates of 2023-24.   Non-tax revenue is estimated to increase by about 25% at the revised stage in 2023-24.  This is mainly on account of higher dividend/surplus of RBI, nationalised banks and financial institutions.

Expenditure Highlights for 2024-25 

Total expenditure in 2024-25 is expected to be Rs 47,65,768 crore, which is an increase of 6.1% over the revised estimate of 2023-24.

Department of Economic Affairs (Ministry of Finance): Rs 70,449 crore has been allocated to a new item of expenditure ‘New Schemes’ (details not available).  This accounts for about 84% of the Department’s total allocation.  The entire allocation is for capital expenditure.  

Ministry of Communications: Allocation is estimated to increase by Rs 14,507 crore (11.8%) in 2024-25, over the revised estimate of 2023-24.  This is mainly on account of capital infusion into BSNL, which is estimated to be Rs 82,916 crore in 2024-25.  This capital infusion is 28% higher than the revised estimates of 2023-24.  

Ministry of Defence: Allocation is estimated to decrease by Rs 2,348 crore (0.4%) in 2024-25, over the revised estimate of 2023-24.  This is mainly on account of a decrease in the allocation towards across Stores.   The aggregate allocation towards Stores in 2024-25 across services is estimated to be Rs 16,873 crore, lower than the revised estimates of 2023-24 (26% decrease).

Expenditure on Subsidies

In 2024-25, the total expenditure on subsidies is estimated to be Rs 4,09,723 crore, a decrease of 7% from the revised estimate of 2023-24 (Table 5).

Food subsidy: Allocation for food subsidy is estimated at Rs 2,05,250 crore in 2024-25, a 3.3% decrease over the revised estimate of 2023-24.  A higher level of food subsidy was budgeted in 2021-22 and 2022-23.  This was mainly on account of PMGKAY, which provides free additional foodgrains to eligible beneficiaries to mitigate the impact of COVID.  This additional benefit ended in December 2022.    

Fertiliser subsidy: Expenditure on fertiliser subsidy is estimated at Rs 1,64,000 crore in 2024-25.  This is a decrease of Rs 24,894 crore (13.2%) from the revised estimate of 2023-24.  Fertiliser subsidy was increased substantially in 2022-23 due to a sharp increase in the international prices of raw materials used in the manufacturing of fertilisers.

Expenditure on other subsidies includes interest subsidies for various government schemes and LPG subsidy.  In 2024-25, expenditure on these subsidies is estimated to increase by 3% over the revised estimate of 2023-24.

Expenditure on Major Schemes

Table 6: Scheme wise allocation in 2024-25 (Rs crore)

 


Sources: Expenditure Profile, Union Budget 2024-25; PRS.  

MGNREGS has the highest allocation in 2024-25 at Rs 86,000 crore.  This amount is the same as the revised estimate for 2023-24.  In 2023-24, allocation on the scheme is estimated to increase by 43% over the budget estimate.  

The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana has the second highest allocation in 2024-25 at Rs 80,671 crore, an increase of 49.1% over the revised estimate of 2023-24.  In 2023-24, expenditure for the scheme is expected to be lower by 32% as compared to the budget estimates.  This was mainly on account of the rural component falling short of original plans.   The allocation for 2024-25 is similar to the budget estimate for 2023-24.

The Jal Jeevan Mission has the third highest allocation in 2024-25 at Rs 70,163 crore, an increase of 0.2% over the revised estimate of 2023-24.  PM KISAN has been allocated Rs 60,000 crore in 2024-25, which is the same as the revised estimate of 2023-24.

Loans to states for capital expenditure

The Centre has budgeted Rs 1,30,000 crore for special interest-free loans to states for capital expenditure in 2024-25.  The same amount had been budgeted in 2023-24, which has been reduced to Rs 1,05,551 crore in the revised estimates.

Programmes for the welfare of women and children have been allocated Rs 4,19,183 crore in 2024-25, an increase of 18.6% over the revised estimate of 2023-24.  These allocations include programmes being implemented across all ministries.  

Allocation towards the welfare of women is expected to increase due to a higher allocation towards the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana.  Under the Awas Yojana, the female head of the family must be the owner or co-owner of the house.  

Allocation towards the welfare of children is expected to increase due to a higher allocation towards school education.  

Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management targets

The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003 requires the central government to progressively reduce its outstanding debt, revenue deficit and fiscal deficit, and to give three year rolling targets for these.  Note that the Medium-Term Fiscal Policy Statement has not provided rolling targets for budget deficits since 2021-22.  In the Budget speech, the Finance Minister reiterated the government’s aim to reduce fiscal deficit to below 4.5% of GDP by 2025-26.

Fiscal deficit is an indicator of borrowings by the government for financing its expenditure.  The estimated fiscal deficit for 2024-25 is 5.1% of GDP.

Revenue deficit is the excess of revenue expenditure over revenue receipts.  Such a deficit implies that the government needs to borrow funds to meet recurring expenses which may not provide future returns. The estimated revenue deficit for 2024-25 is 2% of GDP.

This is lower than the revised estimates of 2023-24 (2.8%).   Revenue receipts are estimated to increase by 11% in 2024-25, while revenue expenditure is estimated to increase by 3%.  Growth in revenue receipts is driven by corporate tax and income tax, which is estimated to grow by 13% each.

Primary deficit is fiscal deficit less interest payments.  It is estimated to be 1.5% of GDP in 2024-25.

Outstanding liabilities is the accumulation of borrowings over the years.  A higher debt implies that the government has a higher loan repayment obligation over the years.
Centre’s outstanding liabilities in 2024-25 are estimated to be 57% of the GDP.  Outstanding liabilities had declined from 51% in 2013-14 to 48% in 2018-19.  From 2019-20 onwards, outstanding liabilities have been increasing, and had reached a high of 61% in 2020-21, and have moderated thereafter.    
Interest payments as a percentage of revenue receipts increased from 37% in 2013-14 to 42% in 2020-21.  It is estimated to be 40% of revenue receipts in 2024-25.
