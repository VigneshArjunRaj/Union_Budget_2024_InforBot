Table 5: Ministry-wise expenditure in 2023-24 (Rs crore)

 


Sources:  Expenditure Budget, Union Budget 2023-24; PRS.

Railways: Allocation is estimated to increase by Rs 78,956 crore (48.6%) in 2023-24, over the revised estimate of 2022-23.  This is mainly on account of increased capital outlay on commercial lines.

Jal Shakti: Allocation to the Ministry of Jal Shakti is estimated to increase by Rs 23,249 crore (31.4%) in 2023-24, driven by an increase in the allocation for Jal Jeevan Mission.

Road Transport and Highways: Allocation in 2023-24 is estimated to increase by Rs 53,408 crore (24.6%), on account of an increase on capital outlay on roads and bridges (24.5%).

Allocation towards the Ministries of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, and Chemicals and Fertilisers have decreased mainly on account of a reduction in food subsidy and fertiliser subsidy.  We discuss the expenditure on subsidies below.

Expenditure on Subsidies

In 2023-24, the total expenditure on subsidies is estimated to be Rs 4,03,084 crore, a decrease of 28.3% from the revised estimate of 2022-23 (Table 6).

Food subsidy: Allocation to food subsidy is estimated at Rs 1,97,350 crore in 2023-24, a 31.3% decrease over the revised estimate of 2022-23.  A higher level of food subsidy was budgeted in 2021-22 and 2022-23 mainly on account of Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana, which provides for free additional foodgrains to eligible beneficiaries to mitigate the impact of COVID-19.  The provision of additional foodgrains was discontinued in December 2022.

Fertiliser subsidy: Expenditure on fertiliser subsidy is estimated at Rs 1,75,100 crore in 2023-24.   This is a decrease of Rs 50,120 crore (22.3%) from the revised estimate of 2022-23.  Fertiliser subsidy for 2022-23 was increased substantially in response to a sharp increase in international prices of raw materials used in the manufacturing of fertilisers.

Other subsidies: Expenditure on other subsidies includes interest subsidies for various government schemes, subsidies for the price support scheme for agricultural produce, and assistance to ship building research and development, among others.   In 2023-24, the expenditure on these other subsidies is estimated to decrease by 30% over the revised estimate of 2022-23.

Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (rural and urban components taken together) has the highest allocation in 2023-24 at Rs 79,590 crore.  This is an increase of 3.2% over the revised estimate of 2022-23.

Table 8: Allocations for women, children, SCs, STs and NER (Rs crore)

 



Sources: Expenditure Profile, Union Budget 2023-24; PRS.

Programmes for the welfare of women and children have been allocated Rs 3,27,010 crore in 2023-24, an increase of 6.3% over the revised estimate of 2022-23.  These allocations include programmes being implemented across all ministries.

The allocation towards North Eastern Region is estimated to increase by 30.5% in 2023-24 over the revised estimates of 2022-23.

Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management targets

The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003 requires the central government to progressively reduce its outstanding debt, revenue deficit and fiscal deficit, and give three year rolling targets.  Note that the Medium-Term Fiscal Policy Statement has not provided rolling targets for budget deficits since 2021-22.  In the Budget speech, the finance minister reiterated the governmentâ€™s aim to reduce fiscal deficit to below 4.5% of GDP by 2025-26.

Fiscal deficit is an indicator of borrowings by the government for financing its expenditure.  The estimated fiscal deficit for 2023-24 is 5.9% of GDP.
 

Revenue deficit is the excess of revenue expenditure over revenue receipts.  Such a deficit implies that the government needs to borrow funds to meet recurring expenses which may not provide future returns.  The estimated revenue deficit for 2023-24 is 2.9% of GDP.

Table 9: FRBM targets for deficits (as % of GDP)

Primary deficit is the difference between fiscal deficit and interest payments.  It is estimated to be 2.3% of GDP in 2023-24.



Note: Data for 2022-23 is revised estimate.
Sources: Budget at a Glance, Union Budget (multiple years); PRS.

In the 2022-23 budget, the government estimated the fiscal deficit to be at 6.4% of GDP, and the revenue deficit to be at 3.8% of GDP.  As per the revised estimates for 2022-23, the ratio of fiscal deficit to GDP is estimated to be the same as budget estimate despite fiscal deficit being higher in nominal terms by Rs 94,123 crore (5.7% overshooting).  This was due to GDP growth being higher than estimated.

Outstanding Liabilities: The central governmentâ€™s outstanding liabilities declined from 51% in 2012-13 to 48% in 2018-19.  From 2019-20 onwards, outstanding liabilities have been increasing, and reached a high of 61% in 2020-21.  They declined to 57% in 2021-22, and are expected to remain at that level in 2023-24.

Outstanding liabilities is the accumulation of borrowings over the years.  A higher debt implies that the government has a higher loan repayment obligation over the years.

The interest payments as a percentage of revenue receipts increased from 36% in 2011-12 to 42% in 2020-21.  As per the budget estimates, this figure is expected to marginally reduce to 41% in 2023-24.
